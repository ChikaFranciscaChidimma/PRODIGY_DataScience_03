📊 Decision Tree Classifier - Predicting Customer Purchases

🔍 Overview
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📌 Dataset
The dataset consists of marketing campaign data, including customer attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous campaign interactions. The goal is to predict the binary outcome: whether a customer subscribes to a product or not.

📂 Dataset Source: UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

🚀 Key Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Decision Tree Model training and evaluation
Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Feature importance analysis
Model interpretation

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning modeling)
Jupyter Notebook

📈 Model Performance
The trained Decision Tree classifier is evaluated using multiple metrics to ensure optimal performance. Insights from the model can help businesses understand which factors influence customer purchases the most.
